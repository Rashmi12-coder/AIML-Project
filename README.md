# AIML-Project
# ðŸŽ¬ Rashmi Recommends â€” Movie Recommendation Engine

A streamlined, multi-method recommendation system built using the MovieLens dataset. This app offers content-based, collaborative, and genre-driven suggestions â€” all through an interactive Streamlit interface.

## ðŸ“¦ What It Does

Users select a movie, and the system returns recommendations using:

- ðŸ”– **Tag-Based Content Filtering** â€“ via tag relevance scores from `genome_scores.csv`
- ðŸ‘¥ **Collaborative Filtering** â€“ using item-based cosine similarity over `ratings.csv`
- ðŸŽ­ **Genre-Based Filtering** â€“ powered by TF-IDF on the `genres` column in `movie.csv`

Each technique provides different yet complementary perspectives on what users might enjoy watching next.
